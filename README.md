University: UIT, Karnavati University

🚀 Project Overview
Finding a vacant seat during peak hours in a university canteen or library is harder than it should be.
Our project tackles this everyday problem by detecting vacant seats in real-time, using computer vision and deep learning.

Built with YOLOv5, OpenCV, and Tkinter, this system helps students quickly locate available seats, saving valuable time and reducing daily frustration.


🎯 Why We Built This

   Save time: Help students avoid wandering around searching for free seats.
   Reduce stress: Ease peak-time crowd management in shared spaces.
   Leverage AI: Build smarter campus facilities through real-time seat detection.

Backend (Planned)	              Flask
Frontend (Planned)	            HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Annotation               	Roboflow
Model Training Environment	    Anaconda + YOLOv5


🧠 How It Works

1. Data Collection:

   Captured canteen images ourselves; used Roboflow datasets for libraries.

2. Annotation and Model Training:

   Labeled data and trained a custom YOLOv5 model (best.pt).

3. Real-Time Detection:

   Webcam captures live feed.
   YOLOv5 detects seats and occupancy.
   Tkinter displays real-time annotated frames.

4. (Next Step):

   Extend it into a web app using Flask for real-time monitoring.


📸 What You’ll See:

  Your webcam will open automatically.
  The system will detect and highlight vacant and occupied seats in real-time.
  The annotated frames will be displayed inside a simple Tkinter window
